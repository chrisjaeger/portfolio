			<p>The organized unit of the United Methodist Women shall be a community of women whose <strong>purpose</strong> is to know God 
					and to experience freedom as whole persons through Jesus Christ; to develop a creative, supportive fellowship; and to expand concepts of mission through participation in the global ministries of the church.

			<p>Our goal is to empower the ministry of Jesus Christ through men within the congregations of the UMC.
			The focus is not inward, concentrating only on those who attend a set meeting, but outward to all men, assisting them to engage the process of spiritual growth.</p>

			<center><h2>United Methodist Youth Group</h2></center><hr>
			<p>Our purpose is to build a personal relationship with each young person that will be the foundation and springboard for effectively sharing the Gospel and encouraging an intimate walk with Our Lord Jesus.  We share the Gospel through devotions, Scripture, prayer, unusual and imaginative games and events, fellowship, missions and service and an abundance of food and snacks. </p>
